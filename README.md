# Background
I had a bad cough in September 2019. My immediate task was to record and publish a DIY learning video. With the video already captured, I could not record audio. 


Now came Python to the rescue, I cooked up a script which would take an .xls file and use the Google Text to Speech engine to generate the audio for me. Crystal clear audio with zero noise. I could have been an American Or a British Female by voice. See the script here (https://github.com/rupin/WrittenAudio) 


Thinking more about this dilemma, I figured that a lot of people still struggle with noise in audio when recording. Cars honking, babies crying, or a plane going above you. All are sources of noise in videos which require expensive audio equipment and ninja sound proofing. 


Fast forward two weeks, with a lot of learning, I could get this web application built which is an extension to my original script, but is much user friendly to use. 

Introducing WrittenAudio (writtenaudio.com). You can look at the video for more details on how the process works.
